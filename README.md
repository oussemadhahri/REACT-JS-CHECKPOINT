# premier (reinitialized)

This workspace has been reinitialized per your request. The previous project files were removed and replaced with a minimal React project skeleton.

Files created/kept:
- `package.json` — minimal scripts for `start`, `build`, `test`.
- `public/index.html` — app entrypoint.
- `src/index.js`, `src/App.js`, `src/index.css` — minimal React app files.

To run locally:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

If you want a different project structure or additional libraries, tell me what to include and I will add them.
